Got it.

Where to build + exact tools to use
Repos (create these now)

hospitalgen-contracts/ — JSON Schemas for Event Envelope, Insight, Topic list. Keep versioned. 

hospitalgen-bridge/ — the “Event Bridge” with two modes: subscribe (FHIR→Pub/Sub→Envelope) and replay (Synthea→Envelope).

hospitalgen-views/ — real-time ED board (state machine) + BigQuery batch marts. 

hospitalgen-insights/ — read-only Insight API that returns JSON with provenance. 

hospitalgen-ui/ — minimal web widget that calls the Insight API. 

Tech choices (beginner-friendly, upgrade later)

Language: Python 3.11 everywhere to start (Bridge, Views, Insight API).

Packaging: Poetry; containerized with Docker.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions → deploy to Cloud Run.

Data: Google Healthcare API (FHIR Store) + Pub/Sub + BigQuery.

Stream bus: start with Pub/Sub, add Kafka at Stage 2 (use Confluent Cloud free tier or a single e2-standard-4 VM for self-host).

Storage/ops: Cloud Storage (dead-letter + logs), Cloud Logging/Monitoring.

Minimal GCP footprint (create once)
gcloud services enable healthcare.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com bigquery.googleapis.com

# FHIR store (in region us-central1 as example)
gcloud healthcare datasets create hospitalgen-ds --location=us-central1
gcloud healthcare fhir-stores create hospitalgen-fhir \
  --dataset=hospitalgen-ds --location=us-central1 \
  --version=R4 --enable-update-create

# Pub/Sub topics (match your fixed topics)
for t in adt.admit adt.discharge results.final meds.administered admin.policy_shock heartbeat;
do gcloud pubsub topics create $t; done

# BigQuery dataset
bq --location=US mk -d hospitalgen


(Your fixed topic list + envelope live in hospitalgen-contracts/; do not change later. 
)

Stage-by-Stage with specific tools
Stage 0 — Sandbox (evening)

Goal: one event flows end-to-end.

Tools:

GCP: FHIR Store, Pub/Sub.

Code: hospitalgen-bridge (Python, FastAPI + google-cloud-pubsub).

Deploy: Cloud Run.

Build:

Bridge/subscribe mode: HTTP endpoint for FHIR Pub/Sub push → wrap as Event Envelope → publish to per-domain topic (start with heartbeat).

Local run: uvicorn app.main:app

Deploy: gcloud run deploy hospitalgen-bridge --source . --allow-unauthenticated

Done when: posting one FHIR Observation yields a proper event with topic, occurred_at, provenance. 

Stage 1 — Historical backfill (weekend)

Goal: history for analytics.

Tools:

Synthea (CLI) → FHIR bundles. 

hospitalgen-bridge replay mode (reads bundles, emits events in clinical order).

Storage: BigQuery for daily tables.

Build:

Generate Lower-Mainland-style patients in Synthea; export FHIR bundles. 

bridge replay --source ./bundles --pace off → publish to adt.*, results.final, meds.administered.

hospitalgen-views/batch/ writes LOS, admit-rate tables into BigQuery via google-cloud-bigquery.

Done when: you can query ED LOS distribution in BigQuery from replayed events. 

Stage 2 — “Living” heartbeat (weekend)

Goal: minute-by-minute updates.

Tools:

Replayer with pacing (e.g., 1 clinical hour = 10 seconds). 

Small simulators for arrivals/lab TAT deltas (Python tasks). 

Kafka: add now (Confluent Cloud or single VM). Bridge dual-publishes Pub/Sub + Kafka. 

hospitalgen-views/realtime/ — state machine to render an ED board from topics.

Build:

Turn on pacing: bridge replay --pace 3600:10

Start ED board service (FastAPI + in-memory store or Redis) that updates on each topic.

If Kafka: use confluent-kafka-python producer/consumer.

Done when: the ED board changes live as events arrive.

Stage 3 — Shocks & policy toggles (1–2 evenings)

Goal: experiments without code changes.

Tools:

Admin CLI: bridge shock --type arrivals --delta 0.2 --duration 12h emits admin.policy_shock.

Views react to shocks (queue sizes, TAT multipliers) at runtime.

Done when: dashboards respond to a shock immediately.

Stage 4 — Insight API (weekend)

Goal: stable read-only contract.

Tools:

hospitalgen-insights (FastAPI).

Schemas: insight_id, logic_id, inputs_span, last_refresh_ts, provenance. 

Build:

Implement lab.explainer that reads results.final + simple rules and returns JSON with provenance. 

hospitalgen-ui calls this endpoint and renders a patient widget.

Done when: UI shows an explainer that updates with new results.

Stage 5 — Analytics/ML

Tools:

BigQuery SQL marts, scheduled queries.

Optional: Vertex AI later (keep off until contracts stabilize).

Data-quality checks on topic freshness/nulls. 

Done when: one small model publishes a risk tier as an insight (with provenance).

Your first 5 commands (copy/paste)

gcloud init

gcloud services enable healthcare.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com bigquery.googleapis.com

Create FHIR store, topics, BQ dataset (block above).

cd hospitalgen-bridge && gcloud run deploy hospitalgen-bridge --source .

gcloud pubsub subscriptions create fhir-push --topic heartbeat --push-endpoint=https://<bridge-url>/pubsub/push

When to add Kafka exactly

Add at Stage 2 only. Keep Pub/Sub as source of truth. Bridge dual-publishes; consumers can be moved one by one. 

What Synthea can and cannot do

Great for historical bundles; it does not stream real time. Use Replay + Heartbeat + Shocks in the Bridge to achieve “living” behavior.
